# Development

## Pipenv

This project uses a tool called [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to manage the project dependencies (django, pytest, etc).

To run any command for this project you will want to make sure you are running commands
through from inside `pipenv shell`.
Watching [Brad Traversy's Pipenv Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qmnh5C4Pmo)
might be useful.

### Testing

Assuming you are inside `pipenv shell` you just run `pytest` to run the tests.
